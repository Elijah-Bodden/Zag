Any additional important information (origin, important contributor, etc.)

## Getting Started
### Node.js + npm
#### Installation:
To install in the root of your node project:
```bash
npm i @elijah-bodden/placeholder
```
Or else globally:
```bash
npm i @elijah-bodden/placeholder -g
```
#### Use in-script
To import the module into your node script, paste the following line at the very top:
```JavaScript
const placeholder = require('@elijah-bodden/placeholder')
```
Then, to create a usable intance, add `const someVariable = new placeholder()` anywhere, where 'someVariable' is the name you wish to access it by.
### HTML `script` tag
#### Inclusion
To include the script in your HTML, add the following tag to the top of your document head:
```HTML
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@elijah-bodden/placeholder/index.min.js">
```
#### Use in-script
Then, simply drop in `const someVariable = new placeholder()` anywhere in your script, changing 'someVariable' to the name you want to reference the instance with.
## Examples
### Do Something
```JavaScript
  const Placeholder = require("@elijah-bodden/placeholder");
  const placeholder = new Placeholder()
  /* Expected Output:
    * literally nothing *
  */
```

### Do Something Slightly Less Cool
```JavaScript
  const Placeholder = require("@elijah-bodden/placeholder");
  const placeholder = new Placeholder()
  /* Expected Output:
    * literally nothing *
  */
```
### Do Nothing
```JavaScript
  const Placeholder = require("@elijah-bodden/placeholder");
  const placeholder = new Placeholder()
  /* Expected Output:
    * literally nothing *
  */
```

## Methods
